# Classification of the ImageWoof Dataset
This investigation into the classification of the [ImageWoof dataset](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette#imagewoof) was done as a university assignment in 2020. It explored conventional machine learning approaches along with deep neural networks. 

My experiments can be replicated using `main.py` and my discussion of the experiments and their results can be found in the nodebook `classification.ipynb`.

**Usage**
```
python3 main.py dataset model_type model_name epochs classes 
```
